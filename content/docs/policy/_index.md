## Why prohibit?

LLMs can improve education if used correctly, but using them in certain situations can lead to negative outcomes. In an article written on March 13, 2023 titled, "Chatting and cheating: Ensuring academic integrity in the era of ChatGPT", Cotton et al. outline several negative aspects of ChatGPT.

- The goal of education is the challenge students so that they learn. Using an AI to generate answers removes the challenge and therefore leads to less learning.
- It is unfair to students who put in the hard work of writing an essay on their own when their peers are using ChatGPT to generate the same material.
- Assessing how well a student understand material in the form of an essay is hard to do when an AI generated text can obtain a passing grade. This leads to a devaluation of degrees [4].

However, a blanket ban on GPT in education could cause more problems that it solves. If the proper detection and prevention mechanisms are not in place, banning GPT could lead to only some of the students using the technology and gaining an unfair advantage over the other students.

## Detection

OpenAI has released an AI Text Classifier [5], however this technology has a number of limitations. In addition to this tool emitting both false positives and false negatives, there are several ways to avoid detection including using ChatGPT [6]. In general detecting AI generated text is related to know the limitations and weaknesses of the technologies available. Here are several strategies for detecting AI generated text.

- **Plagiarism Detection**. The [AI Text Classifier](https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier) provided by OpenAI and [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/) are two free tools that can be used to detect AI generated text.
- **Check References**. According the Clare [3], the references ChatGPT creates often "collapses into a haphazard Harvard style." Clare [3] also mentioned a student that fabricated an entire essay combined with a bibliography but the references didn't checkout and the student later confessed to using AI. The current versions of GPT fail to create sophisticated references to reputable sources so requiring writing that involves research can help prevent the use of ChatGPT.
- **Check for Hallucinations**. An AI hallucination is when the AI is confident about a fact because it "seems about right" rather 

## Update Assignment Requirements
- Current events
- Referencing
- Critical Analysis

The problem is that AI is moving faster than education.
Sometimes work arounds are possible.

## Rules

As an educator, it is essential to explicitly state your policy regarding ChatGPT [1],[2]. Mohanad Halaweh, author of "ChatGPT in education: Strategies for responsible implementation", and Stephen Atlas, author of "ChatGPT for Higher Education and Professional Development: A Guide to Conversational AI Guide to Conversational AI" both provide example guidelines that educators can use. Both authors acknowledge that depending on the situation, different policies may apply. 

- Responsibility. Students must take full responsibility for the content of their work even when using GPT is allowed. This seems obvious, but it is easy to overlook when verifying the output of ChatGPT can be time consuming. 


Relevant skills often change new technology and the education system must adapt. For example, the calculator reduced the relevance of multiplying large numbers on paper which then reduces the amount of time spent in school on multiplying by hand. It is hard to tell what 
- Presentations. 


- Information retrieval. Summarize text.
- Take responsibility for the text. Verify it.
- Audit trail of queries.
- Evaluated via presentation
- Plagiarism 

However, settings rules is not always enough. Enforcing rulues is essential but difficult. For example, it is not clear if a student or AI generated an essay. There are several ways to combat this.

One way is to change how

## Alternative assignments

Halaweh[1], Atlas[2] and Clare[2] all provide advice on how to create assignments that limit the possibility of cheating when GPT is banned.

- **Use Current Events**. ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 are both limited in that their data set is cut off at a particular date. This means that it becomes harder for a student to say "Write me an essay about X" where X is an event that happened in the past couple of years [3]. This is not a full proof way to prevent students from using GPT in situations it is banned, but it can help.
- **Require Presentations**. Presenting research is a good way to ensure students learn the material rather then copy the output of an AI. While students can still use ChatGPT to generate a presentation, they at least have to have to copy the material into a powerpoint and memorize the slides.

None of these ways completely prevent students from abusing AI in situations it is banned but they can help. It is important to note that these strategies are workarounds that target the current language models weaknesses, but as these models improve the strategies for preventing their use should change as well.
