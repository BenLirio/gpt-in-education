This website should be titled "Large Language Models in Eduction", but as of this writing, OpenAI's GPT series are the only Large Language Models (LLMs) developed enough to make a significant impact on education. The scope of LLMs go beyond education and there is hype and uncertainty in the tech field regarding generative AI as it simultaneously makes our lives easier while threatening to take our jobs. However, this site focuses on the impact of LLMs in education. It is split into the following sections:

- **Responses**: Universities have posted their thought on ChatGPT.
- **Uses**: Prompts and Tips that you can use to enhance your learning.
- **Concerns**: Issues that arise from overuse or abuse of LLMs.
- **Policy**: A resource for educators looking to update their classroom rules.
