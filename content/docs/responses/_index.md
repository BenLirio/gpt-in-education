# Responses

In response to the release of ChatGPT in November 2022 {{< cite "openai-chatgpt-release" >}}, several universities including Stevens {{< cite "stevens-response" >}}, Harvard {{< cite "harvard-response" >}} and Stanford {{< cite "stanford-response" >}} responded with articles explaining their view on the new technology. The professors who responded have mixed feelings regarding generative AI because it allows students to complete homework assignments. However, some faculty members believe that the benefits of GPT out weigh downsides. The following is a list of ideas common among the university responses.

These responses were given within three months of the release of ChatGPT. This means that, at the time of responding to ChatGPT, the universities have little to no classroom experience.

### College Admissions

The college admissions offices will now have to sift through essay written by both students and AI. The question is: will ChatGPT change who gets accepted into competitive universities? If so, is there a group of people that will be disproportionately impacted by this new technology?

According to Stanford {{< cite "stanford-response" >}}, the accessability of this technology will lead wealthier people to find new ways of standing out from the crowd. Anthony Lising Antonio, associate professor of education, predicts that a "for-profit cottage industry" will develop to help people design competitive applications that stand out from the AI generated mass.

As my worn-out sneakers pounded the sidewalk, the rhythmic thud of my heartbeat filled my ears. Running was the metronome of my life, steady, unyielding, and more than anything, constant. The sun dipped beneath the horizon, and a sliver of moon illuminated the sky. The question, however, lingered in my mind as I ran: Can I break free from the confines of my small town and create a meaningful impact on the world?

My life began in a rural town so remote that it could have been plucked straight out of a Steinbeck novel. Growing up, I was immersed in a cultural tapestry of cornfields, pick-up trucks, and Friday night football games. While my roots are deep, I found myself yearning for more - a life beyond the finite boundaries of my hometown. My curiosity spurred me to explore, ultimately leading to an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a deep-seated desire to make a difference.

One fateful day, I stumbled upon an old, dusty book buried beneath a pile of outdated encyclopedias at our local library. It was a collection of essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson. As I read, I became entranced by his philosophies of self-reliance and the pursuit of truth. Emerson's words resonated within me, igniting a spark that ultimately ignited my passion for literature and a desire to explore the world through the eyes of great thinkers.

This newfound passion led me to establish a monthly book club at our local community center. I was determined to bring people together to discuss literature, exchange ideas, and inspire one another to dream big. Our motley crew of literary aficionados consisted of farmers, factory workers, and high school students alike. The first few meetings were awkward, but as the months progressed, I watched with pride as our group coalesced into a community of engaged, thoughtful citizens.

The power of literature, I discovered, transcends the borders of geography and age. It creates a common ground upon which we can challenge our beliefs, explore the depths of the human experience, and dare to envision a brighter future. It was in those moments, sharing ideas and laughter in our book club meetings, that I realized the true potential of education: to transform lives and unite people in the pursuit of knowledge.

At Harvard, I see an opportunity to delve deeper into this transformative power of learning. I hope to collaborate with my peers, engage with brilliant professors, and work together to solve the complex challenges facing our world. The hallowed halls of Harvard hold the promise of intellectual growth and the chance to develop the tools necessary to make a lasting impact on the world.

As I stride forward, my sneakers still beating a familiar rhythm against the pavement, I am filled with a sense of purpose. I am ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. I am prepared to step beyond the confines of my small town and embark on the journey of a lifetime.

So here I stand, at the precipice of a new beginning, with the words of Emerson echoing in my mind: "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail." At Harvard, I am determined to blaze a trail that leads not only to personal growth but also to a brighter, more connected world for all.

### Helps Teachers

ChatGPT can make teachers more effective. In February 2023, Harvard described the positive and negative impact ChatGPT will have on the classroom. Regarding the positives, they focused on how teachers can use it to create review sessions, automatically grade homework, and emulate conversation for language learning {{< cite "harvard-response" >}}.

### Be Cautious

ChatGPT is a tool and the output of this tool can mislead students. I asked a Professor Schaumann, a computer science professor at Stevens, how ChatGPT will impact education. In contrast with the articles released early this year, Professor Schaumann has had an entire semester of classroom experience with these tools. His response differed from the standard response of either trying to promote or detect cheating using ChatGPT. Instead, he focused on the danger ChatGPT has to students.

If students use ChatGPT to learn information they do not already know, then how will they verify that the output of ChatGPT is correct? The problem is that ChatGPT can generate text that looks reasonable, but the facts it points out are often false. The same problem occurs when students trust the first article they read after Google searching a question. Professor Schaumann recommends that, when using Google or ChatGPT to answer questions, students ask themselves, "(a) what you're asking, (b) if what you're asking is actually what you need to know, (c) if what you found does actually answer your question, and (d) what assumptions or shortcuts the answer is making."

### Overreliance

If a student graduates from highschool, or university by using ChatGPT to solve their homework, the question becomes: did the student graduate, or did ChatGPT graduate. The Harvard business publishing states that students can over use generative AI and "miss out on important learning opportunities" {{< cite "harvard-response" >}}.

In general, when people depend on unreliable technology, it can lead to problems. For example, I always use Google Maps when I drive and, while the technology is more reliable than my memory, my phone battery is unreliable. When my phone does I am lost and have to stop to charge my phone or drive out of the way until I recognize a road. This example demonstrates that becoming reliant on a technology that is not always available can be a problem. As of this writing ChatGPT is far from reliable as it requires an internet connection, paid subscription (to have access when servers are overloaded), and often outputs fabricated facts. If tech companies can fix these problems and make language models reliable, then the case against overeliance is diminished.

- **Generates Writing Samples**. This tool can be used by teachers to quickly generate examples of good and bad writing in different contexts [2]. Yes, it is possible for teachers to come up with these examples on their own, but having an AI do the legwork and verifying the results can save time.
- **Tool for Thinking**. ChatGPT can be used by students to brainstorm different approaches to problems. Writing can be used as a tool for organizing ones thoughts but not everyone has the writings skills necessary to do that. ChatGPT can close this gap and allow more people to benefit from using writing as a way to organize thoughts [2].
- **College Admissions**. AI makes producing high quality admissions essays easier. The problem arises because it college admissions is a competitive process that is more based on how your essay compares with other students essay.
- **Learn ethical use**. Generative AI is here to stay and it is important that students learn how to use these tools ethically [1], [2]. If universities are not teaching students how to use these tool the correct way who will?
- **Overreliance**. Using ChatGPT can cause students to over rely on them [1]. A good analogy is when someone uses google maps every time they drive and then their phone dies while they are half way though a trip and they get lost. In the same way people can become overreliant on AI tools and fail to function when they are taken away.
