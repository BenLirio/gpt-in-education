Prior to the Spring 2023 semester, schools released faculty advice concerning ChatGPT [1],[2],[3]. Because the advice was given by different faculty members and the use of ChatGPT in education is a tough topic, much of the advice contradicted itself. It is best to view this summary as a list of things to consider when deciding what to do about AI in education.

- **Generates Writing Samples**. This tool can be used by teachers to quickly generate examples of good and bad writing in different contexts [2]. Yes, it is possible for teachers to come up with these examples on their own, but having an AI do the legwork and verifying the results can save time.
- **Tool for Thinking**. ChatGPT can be used by students to brainstorm different approaches to problems. Writing can be used as a tool for organizing ones thoughts but not everyone has the writings skills necessary to do that. ChatGPT can close this gap and allow more people to benefit from using writing as a way to organize thoughts [2].
- **College Admissions**. AI makes producing high quality admissions essays easier. The problem arises because it college admissions is a competitive process that is more based on how your essay compares with other students essay.
- **Learn ethical use**. Generative AI is here to stay and it is important that students learn how to use these tools ethically [1], [2]. If universities are not teaching students how to use these tool the correct way who will?
- **Overreliance**. Using ChatGPT can cause students to over rely on them [1]. A good analogy is when someone uses google maps every time they drive and then their phone dies while they are half way though a trip and they get lost. In the same way people can become overreliant on AI tools and fail to function when they are taken away.
